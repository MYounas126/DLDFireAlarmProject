3. Introduction 
The Fire Alarm Project is designed to detect fire promptly and activate a warning system through the use of temperature-sensing components. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the project, detailing its objectives, components, working principle, and significance. 
  
4. Project Description 
The primary objective of the Fire Alarm Project is to detect fire early and trigger an alarm system, providing timely warnings for necessary actions. The project utilizes a 10K Thermistor, LM358 Operational Amplifier, potentiometer, and a buzzer to achieve its functionality. 
  
5. Project Requirements 
5.1 Component List 
10K Thermistor 
LM358 Operational Amplifier 
4.7K Resistor 
10K Potentiometer 
5V Buzzer 
Connecting Wires 
Breadboard 
5V Power Supply 
5.2 Working Principle 
The 10K Thermistor acts as the heat sensor; when the temperature increases, its resistance decreases. The LM358 Operational Amplifier functions in comparator mode, and the potentiometer adjusts the temperature threshold for fire detection. The buzzer is activated when the temperature surpasses the set value.
